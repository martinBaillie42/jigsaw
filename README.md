# Nodejs eCommerce site based on the Jigsaw website

## The goal 

The goal of this project is to build an eCommerce Node website using the minimum number of dependencies possible.

It's all very well being able to use all the latest frameworks and packages, but if you don't know the language or the architecture underneath you're not on very solid foundations. 

Although the goal is to use as few dependencies as possible, there will be some dependencies. The general rule of thumb I am going to use is, "Will I ever be asked to write this functionality myself in my current or a future job?". In the case of a Web Server, it's entirely possible, so I've started writing my own for this project. In the case of a CSS pre-processor it is highly unlikely, so I intend to use SCSS.

Below is a list of all the dependencies I intend to use when it becomes appropriate to do so:

- Mocha
- Chai
- Karma
- SCSS
- React
- Webpack

This list is not exhaustive and will be updated as I continue.

## Project plan

1. Implement server.
2. Create static mockups of site in HTML and SCSS.
3. Implement components using React.
4. Build and deploy project using Webpack.
