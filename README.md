# Nodejs eCommerce site based on the Jigsaw website

## The goals 

The goals of this project are to build an eCommerce Node website using ES6, vanilla JS, and the minimum number of dependencies possible.

Although one of the goals is to use as few dependencies as possible, there will be some dependencies. The general rule of thumb I am going to use is, "Will I ever be asked to write this functionality myself in my current or a future job?". In the case of a Web Server, it's entirely possible, so I've started writing my own for this project. In the case of a CSS pre-processor it is highly unlikely, so I intend to use SCSS.

Below is a list of the dependencies I intend to use:

- Mocha
- Chai
- Karma
- SCSS
- React
- Babel
- Webpack

This list is not exhaustive and will be updated as I continue.

## Project plan

1. Implement server (this will be continuously developed, as the project increases complexity).
2. Create static mockups of the site in HTML and SCSS.
3. Implement components using React.
4. Build and deploy project using Webpack.
